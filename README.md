# DEPRECATED

This repository was created way back when there was not many alternative sources.

This however is no longer the case.
Microsoft now publishes a good amount of different devcontainer images.
There is also a good selections of features aviable to extend them.

- [devcontainer images](https://containers.dev/templates)
- [Features](https://containers.dev/features)



## Example

For custom integrations, you can look at the https://github.com/ludeeus/integration_blueprint repository.
Spesifically:
- [`.devcontainer.json`](https://github.com/ludeeus/integration_blueprint/blob/main/.devcontainer.json)
- [scripts dir instead of `container` CLI](https://github.com/ludeeus/integration_blueprint/tree/main/scripts)
