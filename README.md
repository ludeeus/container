_Custom container images used for stuff._

[The documentation for the container images can be found here](https://ludeeus.github.io/container/)

## Container definitions

The container definitions are located under [./instructions/](https://github.com/ludeeus/container/tree/master/instructions)
There are 3 categories of containers here:

Category | Description
-- | --
Baseimages | These are container bases that are used as a base for other containers, all base images have a `s6` variant, all base images have a `-base` postfix in the name, and all base images are multiarch.
Containers | These are containers that are ready to be used.
Development | These are containers that are perfect for development, preferably by using it as a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

[Examples for devcontainer definitions can be found here](https://github.com/ludeeus/container/tree/master/devcontainer_samplefiles)


## Container instructions

The container instructions are defined using `YAML`, this is a list of the supported YAML tags that can be used:
The tag of the container will be the same as the filename of the instruction file (without the `.yaml` postfix).

YAML tag | Optional | Type | Desctiption
-- | -- | -- |--
`base` | False | string | This is the base image
`description` | True | string | A short description of the container (used for documentation).
`needs` | True | list of strings | A list of other tags this container relies on.
`env` | True | map | A key-value map of environment variables.
`S6` | True | boolean | A boolean to set if S6 overlay is added to the container (defaults to false).
`alpine-packages` | True | list of strings | A list of alpine packages to add to the container.
`debian-packages` | True | list of strings | A list of debian packages to add to the container.
`pyhton-packages` | True | list of strings | A list of python packages to add to the container.
`run` | True | list of string  | Additional "RUN" stepes to add to the container.
`entrypoint` | True | list of strings | This will be used as the "ENTRYPOINT" in the images.
`documentation` | True | string | Additional documentation for the container.

If files/more complicated scripts are needed to build the container, these can be added to a tag spesific directory under [./rootfs/](https://github.com/ludeeus/container/tree/master/rootfs).
